        <h3>Two Strategies to Combat Fading Motivation</h3>

          The expectation is that you have performed your habit at least 5-10
          times by this point. It’s possible that what we have covered so far is
          all you need to build a new habit. And, if so, that’s fine. The whole
          point of this course is to get you results. If it’s working, then it’s
          working. There’s no need to make it more complex than it needs to be.
          However, you may have noticed that you started strong and were feeling
          motivated but have since fallen off course and struggled to complete
          your habit more than once or twice. This decline in motivation is
          something that everyone experiences from time to time. In many areas
          of life, we assume that if we put in a little bit of effort, we’ll get
          a little bit of results. So, naturally, when we’re trying our best and
          putting in a lot of effort, we think we should get a lot of results.
          But habits don’t really work this way. Rather than having some linear
          relationship with achievement, habits tend to have more of a compound
          growth curve. The greatest returns are delayed. This gap between what
          we expect and what we experience is what I refer to as the “plateau of
          latent potential.” This plateau plays a role in any journey of
          improvement. You’re putting in work each day, but you feel stuck in
          this valley of death. You’re accumulating potential, but it hasn’t
          been released yet. It’s all effort, and no reward. This can be a
          frustrating experience, and you need something to help you stick with
          it while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to accumulate. I’d
          like to share two strategies you can employ to stick with a habit when
          your motivation begins to fade. The first is called “temptation
          bundling.” Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to
          do with an action you need do. You’re more likely to find a behavior
          attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same
          time. Perhaps you want to watch your favorite TV show, but you really
          need to fold a basket of laundry. Using temptation bundling, you could
          only watch that show when you are folding laundry. Of course, some
          people find it hard to implement these strategies. When you know you
          can watch a show anytime without folding the laundry, it becomes easy
          to skip the “need to do” part and jump straight to the “want to do”
          portion. Thankfully, you can also use temptation bundling to make the
          process itself more enjoyable rather than only allowing yourself to
          enjoy something at certain times. Maybe you want to indulge in a few
          pieces of your favorite candy, but you need to work on your book
          manuscript. Solution: only allow yourself to eat your favorite candy
          when you sit down to work on your book.
